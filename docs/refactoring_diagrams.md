# Zig HTTP Client Example - Refactoring Documentation

This document provides visual explanations of the refactoring changes made to the Zig HTTP Client Example project.

## Before vs After Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Before Refactoring"
    A1[Custom URL Parsing] --> B1[Manual String Manipulation]
    B1 --> C1[Custom Parameter Encoding]
    C1 --> D1[Custom URL Encoding]
    end

    subgraph "After Refactoring"
    A2[Standard Library Uri.parse] --> B2[StringHashMap & BufMap]
    B2 --> C2[Improved Parameter Encoding]
    C2 --> D2[Simplified URL Building]
    end
```

The diagram above shows the high-level changes made during the refactoring process.

## Refactoring Changes

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "URL Handling"
    A1[Custom parseUrl] --> A2[Standard Uri.parse]
    end

    subgraph "Parameter Handling"
    B1[Array of Pairs] --> B2[StringHashMap]
    B3[Manual Iteration] --> B4[BufMap]
    end

    subgraph "String Manipulation"
    C1[Manual Concatenation] --> C2[fmt.bufPrint]
    C3[Custom Formatting] --> C4[Standard Formatting]
    end

    subgraph "Error Handling"
    D1[Basic Error Handling] --> D2[errdefer for Cleanup]
    end
```

The diagram above shows the specific changes made in different areas of the codebase.

## Data Flow Improvements

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Before"
    A1[Parameters as Array] --> B1[Manual Encoding]
    B1 --> C1[String Concatenation]
    C1 --> D1[URL String]
    end

    subgraph "After"
    A2[Parameters as HashMap] --> B2[BufMap Processing]
    B2 --> C2[Standard Library Functions]
    C2 --> D2[URL String]
    end
```

The diagram above shows how the data flow was improved during the refactoring process.

## Memory Management Improvements

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Before"
    A1[Manual Memory Allocation] --> B1[Manual Cleanup]
    B1 --> C1[Potential Memory Leaks]
    end

    subgraph "After"
    A2[Standard Allocator Functions] --> B2[defer and errdefer]
    B2 --> C2[Safer Memory Management]
    end
```

The diagram above shows the improvements in memory management made during the refactoring process.

## Test Improvements

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Before"
    A1[Basic Tests] --> B1[Manual Test Setup]
    B1 --> C1[Limited Test Coverage]
    end

    subgraph "After"
    A2[Enhanced Tests] --> B2[Standard Testing Utilities]
    B2 --> C2[Better Test Organization]
    end
```

The diagram above shows the improvements made to the tests during the refactoring process.

## Standard Library Usage

```mermaid
pie
    title "Standard Library Usage"
    "Before Refactoring" : 30
    "After Refactoring" : 70
```

The chart above shows the approximate increase in standard library usage after refactoring.
